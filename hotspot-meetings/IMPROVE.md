### Code quality

To improve code quality, duplicate logic like the retry mechanism should be abstracted into a reusable utility to keep things consistent and maintainable. Adding JSDoc comments or transitioning to TypeScript would bring better type safety and developer experience. Consistent naming conventions and breaking utility functions like property filtering and mapping into their own modules would make the code more readable and organized.

### Project architecture

For project architecture, the monolithic worker.js file should be split into smaller, more focused files. Each domain (meetings, contacts, companies) should have its own module, while queue management and HubSpot API interactions can be centralized in dedicated services. A modular folder structure that groups domains, services, and utilities would make the code easier to navigate, maintain, and scale.

### Code performance

In terms of performance, batch processing needs to be optimized with tools like Promise.all or controlled concurrency via libraries like p-limit. Database updates should focus on specific fields to avoid unnecessary operations. Implementing caching for frequently queried data can cut down redundant API calls, and preemptively refreshing tokens would prevent delays. Flattening nested loops and improving data pagination would also help the project handle larger datasets and workloads more efficiently.
